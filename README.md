# Task-Rabbit
A online courier service where a customer can request from a service from a rabbit (courier) with authentication and payment processing for the services offered by the rabbit. By the way, this is not a clone of taskrabbit the US company, I recently just discovered there is actually a company called taskrabbit. My bad ðŸ˜… Please don't sue me. It is purely a thought up name. There is no way I could have known there is a company named so. Anyway, Enjoy!
